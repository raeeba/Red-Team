# Red-Team
This project was developed as part of the 420-436-VA System Development and 420-411-VA eCommerce courses at Vanier College.

The Red Team created a web application for GeorgesAMO, a construction business based in Quebec. The application's primary function is to be an **Inventory Management System**, however it also includes other features, such as an **Employee Management System**, and a **Calculator**. Both the Inventory Management System and Employee Management System implement the basic CRUD operations.

The web application implements:
* CRUD operations,
  Users may perform the basic CRUD operations in both the *Inventory Management* and *Employee Management* pages of the web application.
  
* User rights,
  The application has two types of user: Admins and Super Admins. Each type of user has a specific set of rights, meaning they have access to different features of the application.
  
* Database,
  A database with all user and product information is connected to the web application.
  
* Two-Factor Authentication,
  For enhanced security, users must enter a code that is sent to their email to login to the application.
  
* MVC (Model-View-Controller) structure.
  The code is structured following the MVC design pattern.

For more information on the functioning of the application, please view the **User Guide** located in the [Documentation](https://github.com/raeeba/Red-Team/tree/main/Documentation#project-documentation) section of this repository.
