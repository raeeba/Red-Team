# Georges AMO Web Application
This project was developed as part of the 420-436-VA System Development and 420-411-VA eCommerce courses at Vanier College.

Our team created a web application for Georges AMO, a construction business based in Quebec. The application's primary function is to be an **Inventory Management System**, however it also includes other features, such as an **Employee Management System**, and a **Calculator**. 

The web application implements:
* **CRUD operations:**
  Users may perform the basic CRUD operations in both the *Inventory Management* and *Employee Management* pages of the web application.
  
* **User rights:**
  The application has two types of users: Admins and Super Admins. Each type of user has a specific set of rights, meaning they have access to different features of the application.
  
* **Database:**
  A database with all user and product information is connected to the web application. The database has also been normalized to the third normal form (3NF) to prevent redundancies in the data.
  
* **Two-factor authentication:**
  For enhanced security, users must enter a code that is sent to their email to login to the application.
  
* **MVC (Model-View-Controller) structure:**
  The code is structured following the MVC design pattern.

For more information on the functioning of the application, please view the **User Guide** located in the [Documentation](https://github.com/raeeba/Red-Team/tree/main/Documentation#project-documentation) section of this repository.
