# Red-Team
This project was developed as part of the 420-436-VA System Development and 420-411-VA eCommerce courses at Vanier College.

The Red Team created a web application for GeorgesAMO, a construction business based in Quebec. The application's primary function is to be an **Inventory Management System**, however it also includes other features, such as an **Employee Management System**, and a **Calculator**. Both the Inventory Management System and Employee Management System implement the basic CRUD operations.

The web application implements:
* CRUD operations,
* User rights,
* Database,
* 2-Factor Authentication,
* MVC structure.


For more information on the functioning of the application, please view the **User Guide** located in the [Documentation]() section of this repository.

Documents detailing the project development process can also be found in the in the [Documentation]() section under **Deliverables** and **Project Management**.
